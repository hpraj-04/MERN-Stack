        <p>The first sentence of your paragraph should offer the reader an idea of the type of information they may expect to find when they read the rest. The initial sentences should construct a scenario that will set the tone for the rest of the sentence.  And the rest of the sentence should strive to maintain the same theme.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="two">
        <p>The essential sentences in the paragraph should be supplemented by the middle sentence. You can use this middle sentence to persuade the reader of the main point you made in the beginning. Expand every detail so the viewers can perceive everything from your point of view.</p>
